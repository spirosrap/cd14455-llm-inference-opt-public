    "# Exercise: Strategic Pruning - Method vs. Target\n",
    "\n",
    "**Welcome to the Exercise!**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will explore the nuances of **unstructured pruning**. We'll move beyond simply removing weights and investigate how the *strategy* of pruning affects a model's performance. We'll use a powerful model, `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B`, to see these effects clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our Goal:**\n",
    "To answer two key strategic questions about pruning, even *before* any fine-tuning:\n",
    "1.  **Part A (Method Comparison):** Is it better to prune the *least important* weights (Magnitude Pruning) or prune weights *at random*?\n",
    "2.  **Part B (Target Comparison):** Is it more harmful to prune the **MLP layers** (which handle knowledge) or the **Attention layers** (which handle context)?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will measure output quality and inference speed to understand the impact of these strategic choices."

    "\n",
    "1.  **Part A (Method)**: Look at the outputs for \"Part A: Magnitude Pruned\" vs. \"Part A: Random Pruned\". Which one produced a more coherent or sensible output? Did this align with the idea that magnitude pruning is more intelligent?\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Part B (Target)**: Compare the outputs for \"Part B: Pruned MLP Layers\" vs. \"Part B: Pruned Attention Layers\". Did pruning one type of layer seem to harm the model's output quality more than the other? What does this suggest about the roles of these different layers?\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Speed-up**: Did you observe a significant inference speed-up from unstructured pruning? Why might the speed-up be less than what you'd expect from removing 40% of the computations? (Hint: Think about dense vs. sparse hardware operations).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Overall Conclusion**: Based on this experiment, what is a more effective pruning strategy for this model before fine-tuning? And what is the crucial next step that would be required to make these pruned models practically useful?"

    "### Sample Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Part A Analysis**: Magnitude pruning clearly preserved the quality of the text much better than random pruning. The output from the magnitude-pruned model was coherent and sensible, whereas the random-pruned model produced a less logical continuation. This strongly supports the hypothesis that low-magnitude weights contribute less to the model's performance, and removing them is less damaging than removing weights randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Part B Analysis**: Both pruning MLP and Attention layers resulted in a noticeable drop in quality. However, pruning the attention layers seemed to cause more severe degradation, often leading to more repetitive or nonsensical output. This suggests that for Llama-3.2-1B, the attention mechanisms might be more sensitive to pruning than the MLP blocks, as they are fundamental to processing context and relationships between tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Speed-up Analysis**: The speed-up from unstructured pruning was modest. While 40% of the weights were removed, the inference time did not decrease by 40%. This is because standard hardware (GPUs) and deep learning libraries are highly optimized for **dense** matrix multiplications. Unstructured pruning creates sparse matrices, but without specialized hardware or software (sparse kernels) that can skip the zero-multiplications, the overall computation time isn't drastically reduced. The speed-up we see is likely due to secondary effects like reduced memory access, but not from skipping computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Overall Conclusion**: The most effective pre-finetuning strategy observed is **magnitude-based pruning**, as it best preserves model quality. Furthermore, it appears that **MLP layers are a safer target** for pruning than attention layers. The absolutely critical next step for any of these pruned models would be **fine-tuning**. Fine-tuning allows the remaining weights in the network to adjust and compensate for the information lost during pruning, which is essential for recovering performance and making the smaller, faster model practically useful."
