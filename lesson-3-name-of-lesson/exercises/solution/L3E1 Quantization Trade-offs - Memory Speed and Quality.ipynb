    "\n",
    "**Welcome to the Exercise!**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the demo, we saw how easy it is to reduce a model's memory footprint using Post-Training Quantization (PTQ). But memory is only one part of the story. In this exercise, we will perform a comprehensive analysis of the real-world trade-offs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our Goal:**\n",
    "To systematically measure and analyze the impact of different quantization levels on a `GPT-2` model across three key dimensions:\n",
    "1.  **Memory Footprint:** How much VRAM/RAM does the model use?\n",
    "2.  **Inference Speed (Latency):** How quickly does the model generate text?\n",
    "3.  **Output Quality:** Does the generated text become less coherent or accurate?\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you'll have a clear, data-driven understanding of the pros and cons of each precision level."

    "### Sample Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Memory Scaling**: The memory footprint decreased significantly with lower precision, as expected. FP16 used the most memory. INT8 used roughly half of that, and the 4-bit formats (NF4, FP4) used roughly half of the INT8 memory. This aligns with the theoretical bit-width reductions (16-bit -> 8-bit -> 4-bit).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Latency Changes**: Yes, latency consistently and dramatically decreased with lower precision. This is because operations on integers (INT8) and specialized 4-bit formats are computationally much cheaper and faster on modern GPUs, which have dedicated hardware (like Tensor Cores) optimized for these lower-precision calculations. Moving smaller data types from memory to the compute units is also faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Quality Degradation**: For GPT-2, the FP16 and INT8 models produced very similar and coherent outputs. Quality was well-maintained. A noticeable degradation started with the 4-bit formats (NF4 and FP4). The text became more repetitive and less logical, especially for the more open-ended prompt, \"Once upon a time...\". The factual prompt, \"The capital of France is...\", held up better even at lower precisions, but still showed signs of quality loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Key Trade-offs & Conclusion**:\n",
    "    *   **FP16**: Best quality, but highest memory usage and slowest speed. Best for offline tasks where quality is paramount.\n",
    "    *   **INT8**: The \"sweet spot\" for this model. It provides a significant speedup (~2-3x) and memory reduction with almost no perceptible loss in quality. This would be an excellent choice for a server deployment balancing performance and accuracy.\n",
    "    *   **NF4/FP4**: Extreme memory savings and the fastest performance. However, this comes at a clear cost to output quality. This would be the choice for a severely resource-constrained environment like an edge or mobile device, where just being able to *run* the model is the primary goal, and some quality degradation is an acceptable trade-off."
