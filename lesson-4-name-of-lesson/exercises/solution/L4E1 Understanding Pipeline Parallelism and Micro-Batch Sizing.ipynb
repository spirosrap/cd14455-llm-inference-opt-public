    "# Exercise: Understanding Pipeline Parallelism and Micro-Batch Sizing\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate how to correctly configure a model for pipeline parallelism and to explore the performance impact of the `micro_batch_size` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will:\n",
    "1.  **Define a model** and a script to run it, highlighting a common pitfall (`nn.ModuleList` vs. `nn.Sequential`) that prevents automatic partitioning.\n",
    "2.  **Create multiple DeepSpeed configs** to test different `micro_batch_size` values.\n",
    "3.  **Run experiments** using the `deepspeed` launcher.\n",
    "4.  **Analyze the results** to understand the trade-offs of micro-batch sizing."

    "#### Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The `RealisticModel` class defines a simple transformer-like model. A key aspect for DeepSpeed's pipeline parallelism is how the model layers are structured. \n",
    "\n",
    "DeepSpeed's automatic partitioning works best with `nn.Sequential` containers, as it can easily divide the layers into stages. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, the student's task is to replace `nn.ModuleList` with `nn.Sequential` to enable efficient pipeline parallelism.\n",
    "\n",
    "`nn.ModuleList` is a list-like container for `nn.Module`'s, but it doesn't have a `forward` method and thus the layers cannot be executed sequentially by simply calling the container. In contrast, `nn.Sequential` wraps a sequence of layers and provides a `forward` method that applies each layer in order, which is what DeepSpeed's pipeline parallelism leverages for automatic partitioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Throughput Measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "The `measure_throughput` function is a helper to benchmark the performance of our model. It runs several iterations of a forward pass with dummy data and calculates the number of samples processed per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Main Execution Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "The `main` function handles the overall execution. It first measures the baseline performance on a single GPU. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, it initializes DeepSpeed, which automatically partitions the model across the available GPUs based on the provided configuration. \n",
